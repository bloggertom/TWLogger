 @class TWSqliteLogger
 
 The TWSqliteLogger class can be used to save logs to a database.
 
 Options passed in set the behaviour for this class.
 
 - loggingAddress sets the location in the file system that logging files will be created.
 
 - pageLife defines how old a log entry can be before it is cleared from the database.
 
 - maxPageSize is ignored.
 
 - maxPageNum is ignored
 
 - flushPeriod defines how long a log is cached before it is flushed to disk. If nil logs will be written immediately. Use this to save performance with multiple successive database writes.
 
 - logFormat is ignored, values are stored in there own columns in the database.
 
 Default options are as follows
 @code
 options.logFilePrefix = @"TWLog";
 options.flushPeriod.seconds = 10;
 options.logFormat = nil;
 @endcode
 
 By default the database will be put in the Documents directory in a @code TWLogFiles @endcode subdirectory.
