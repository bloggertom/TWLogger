 @class TWFileLogger
 
 The TWFileLogger write logs to a file at a specified location.
 
 Options passed in set the behaviour for this class.
 
 - pageLife set the length time a log file is used before a new log file is created.
 
 - maxPageSize sets the maximum size in KiloBytes a log file can be before a new one is created.
 
 - maxPageNum sets the maximum number of pages which can be created in LoggingAddress. Once maxPageNum is met the oldest log file is deleted.
 
 - flushPeriod is ignored and all logs are written to disk immediately.
 
 - cacheSize is ignored and all logs are written to disk immediately.
 
 - metaData key values are logged out at the top of each file.
 
 Default options are as follows
 @code
 options.pageLife.day = 1;
 options.dateTimeFormat = TWDateTimeFormatDefault;
 options.maxPageNum = 80;
 options.maxPageSize = 0;
 options.logFilePrefix = @"TWLog";
 @endcode
 
 By default logs will be put in the Documents directory in a @code TWLogFiles @endcode subdirectory.
